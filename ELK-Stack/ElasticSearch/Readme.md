### ElasticSearch vs DBMS 

* ElasticSearch represents best profit result to the top, but DBMS has not this function
* The results of ElasticSearch are ordered based on the score, but DBMS randomly show results based on index

| Elastic Search | Relational DB |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Index          | Database      |
| Type           | Table         |
| Document       | Row           |
| Field          | Column        |
| Mapping        | Schema        |



* Elastic Search uses REST API

| Elastic Search | Relational DB | CRUD   |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| GET            | Select        | Read   |
| PUT            | Update        | Update |
| POST           | Insert        | Create |
| DELETE         | Delete        | Delete |
